## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   The backend server should now be running.

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend application should now be running and accessible in your browser.

## Infrastructure Provisioning
This project uses Terraform to provision and manage infrastructure.

1. Navigate to the infrastructure directory:
   ```
   cd infrastructure
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```
   terraform init
   ```
   This will download the required providers and initialize the Terraform working directory.

3. Preview the infrastructure changes:
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```
   This will show you what changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure.

4. Apply the infrastructure changes:
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```
   After reviewing the plan, type `yes` to proceed with infrastructure provisioning.
